A modern, pure Go library for reading and writing HDF5 files without CGo dependencies.

Reads files produced by any 1.x/2.x library — including the 2.x "latest" format (data layout v4/v5 with modern chunk indexes), complex datatypes, and float16.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Pure Go** - No CGo, no C dependencies, cross-platform
- ✅ **Modern Design** - Built with Go 1.25+ best practices
- ✅ **Superblocks v0/v2/v3** - Read and write, with checksum validation
- ✅ **Full Dataset Reading** - Compact, contiguous, chunked layouts with GZIP
- ✅ **Rich Datatypes** - Integers, floats, strings (fixed/variable), compounds
- ✅ **Memory Efficient** - Buffer pooling
- ✅ **C-Library Verified** - Write output validated against the official HDF5 tools (h5dump/h5diff/h5repack) in CI
- ✍️ **Comprehensive Write Support** - Datasets, groups, attributes, links, compression

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/shyrmapp/hdf5
```

### Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "github.com/shyrmapp/hdf5"
)

func main() {
    // Open HDF5 file
    file, err := hdf5.Open("data.h5")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer file.Close()

    // Walk through file structure
    file.Walk(func(path string, obj hdf5.Object) {
        switch v := obj.(type) {
        case *hdf5.Group:
            fmt.Printf("📁 %s (%d children)\n", path, len(v.Children()))
        case *hdf5.Dataset:
            fmt.Printf("📊 %s\n", path)
        }
    })
}
```

**Output**:

```
📁 / (2 children)
📊 /temperature
📁 /experiments/ (3 children)
```

## 🎯 Current Status

**Production-ready read/write for default-format HDF5 files.**

### ✅ Fully Implemented

- **File Structure**:
  - Superblock parsing (v0, v2, v3) with checksum validation (CRC32)
  - Object headers v1 (legacy HDF5 < 1.8) with continuations
  - Object headers v2 (modern HDF5 >= 1.8) with continuations
  - Groups (traditional symbol tables + modern object headers)
  - B-trees (leaf + non-leaf nodes for large files)
  - Local heaps (string storage)
  - Global Heap (variable-length data)
  - Fractal heap (direct blocks for dense attributes) ✨ NEW

- **Dataset Reading**:
  - Compact layout (data in object header)
  - Contiguous layout (sequential storage)
  - Chunked layout with B-tree indexing
  - Layout v4/v5 chunk indexes (single chunk, implicit, fixed array, extensible array, v2 B-tree) — HDF5 2.x "latest" files
  - GZIP/Deflate compression
  - LZF compression (h5py/PyTables compatible, read + write)
  - Filter pipeline for compressed data

- **Datatypes** (Read + Write):
  - **Basic types**: int8-64, uint8-64, float32/64
  - **float16** (read): H5T_IEEE_F16LE/BE
  - **Complex** (read): HDF5 2.0 class 11 as complex128/complex64
  - **Strings**: Fixed-length (null/space/null-padded), variable-length (via Global Heap)
  - **Advanced types**: Arrays, Enums, References (object/region), Opaque
  - **Compound types**: Struct-like with nested members

- **Attributes**:
  - Compact attributes (in object header) ✨ NEW
  - Dense attributes (fractal heap foundation) ✨ NEW
  - Attribute reading for groups and datasets ✨ NEW
  - Full attribute API (Group.Attributes(), Dataset.Attributes()) ✨ NEW

- **Navigation**: Full file tree traversal via Walk()

- **Code Quality**:
  - Test coverage: 88%+ library packages (target: >70%) ✅
  - Lint issues: 0 (34+ linters) ✅
  - TODO items: 0 (all resolved) ✅
  - Official HDF5 test suite: 433 files, 100% pass rate ✅

- **Security** ✨ NEW:
  - 4 CVEs fixed (CVE-2025-7067, CVE-2025-6269, CVE-2025-2926, CVE-2025-44905) ✅
  - Overflow protection throughout (SafeMultiply, buffer validation) ✅
  - Security limits: 1GB chunks, 64MB attributes, 16MB strings ✅
  - 39 security test cases, all passing ✅

### ✍️ Write Support - Feature Complete!

**Production-ready write support with all features!** ✅

**Dataset Operations**:

- ✅ Create datasets (all layouts: contiguous, chunked, compact)
- ✅ Write data (all datatypes including compound)
- ✅ Dataset resizing with unlimited dimensions
- ✅ Variable-length datatypes: strings, ragged arrays
- ✅ Compression (GZIP, Shuffle, Fletcher32)
- ✅ Array and enum datatypes
- ✅ References and opaque types
- ✅ Attribute writing (dense & compact storage)
- ✅ Attribute modification/deletion

**Links**:

- ✅ Hard links (full support)
- ✅ Soft links (symbolic references - full support)
- ✅ External links (cross-file references - full support)

**Read Enhancements**:

- ✅ Hyperslab selection (data slicing) - 10-250x faster!
- ✅ Efficient partial dataset reading
- ✅ Stride and block support
- ✅ Chunk-aware reading (reads ONLY needed chunks)
- ✅ **ChunkIterator API** - Memory-efficient iteration over large datasets

**Validation**:

- ✅ Official HDF5 Test Suite: 100% pass rate (378/378 files)
- ✅ Production quality confirmed

**Future Enhancements**:

- ✅ LZF filter (read + write, Pure Go)
- ✅ BZIP2 filter (read only, stdlib)
- ⚠️ SZIP filter (stub - requires libaec)
- ⚠️ Thread-safety with mutexes + SWMR mode
- ⚠️ Parallel I/O

### ❌ Planned Features

**Next Steps** - See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for complete timeline and versioning strategy.

| Feature               | This Library       | gonum/hdf5     | go-hdf5/hdf5 |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| Pure Go               | ✅ Yes             | ❌ CGo wrapper | ✅ Yes       |
| Reading               | ✅ Full            | ✅ Full        | ❌ Limited   |
| Writing               | ✅ Full            | ✅ Full        | ❌ No        |
| HDF5 1.8+             | ✅ Yes             | ⚠️ Limited     | ❌ No        |
| Advanced Datatypes    | ✅ All             | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No        |
| Test Suite Validation | ✅ 100% (378/378)  | ⚠️ Unknown     | ❌ No        |
| Maintained            | ✅ Active          | ⚠️ Slow        | ❌ Inactive  |
| Thread-safe           | ⚠️ User must sync* | ⚠️ Conditional | ❌ No        |

\* Different `File` instances are independent. Concurrent access to same `File` requires user synchronization (standard Go practice). Full thread-safety with mutexes + SWMR mode planned for future releases.
